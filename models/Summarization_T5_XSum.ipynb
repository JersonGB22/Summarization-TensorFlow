        "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a text summarization model, a task within natural language processing (NLP) that involves creating a shorter version of a document or article, capturing all essential information. Specifically, an abstractive summarization model will be developed, generating new text that synthesizes the most relevant information. The [Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5) model, specifically the [Base](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-base) version with 220 million parameters, available on [Hugging Face 🤗](https://huggingface.co/), will be fine-tuned. The fine-tuning is performed using the [Extreme Summarization (XSum) Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EdinburghNLP/xsum), which contains BBC news articles (mostly quite extensive) along with their corresponding concise single-sentence summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, this notebook will compare the results of this model with those of the [Transformer model](https://github.com/JersonGB22/Summarization-TensorFlow/blob/main/models/Summarization_Transformer_XSum.ipynb) trained from scratch with the XSum dataset."

We\\'re off to Wembley to play Chelsea in a cup final nobody cares about tomorrow. Get a wriggle on.\"\\nThe reaction of Aguero and Yaya Toure would be priceless.\\nBut that\\'s pretty much the gist of the chat that faced the then Manchester City side and their fellow Full Members Cup finalists of exactly 30 years ago.\\nWhat do you mean you\\'ve never heard of it? What about the Simod Cup? ZDS Cup? Ring any bells?\\nThe much-derided competition, which ran from 1986 until 1992, was for teams in the top two divisions, but snubbed by the big clubs and initially largely ignored by fans of the teams who did actually enter.\\nIt was a different era, of course. Very much pre-Premier League. Mudbath pitches, near maimings needed to get yellow cards, with pre-match pasta and post-match warm-downs solely the preserve of wimps.\\nYet 68,000 made it to the final on a sunny spring day in 1986 to watch title-chasing Chelsea edge out a skint City outfit 5-4 in a classic that featured the first Wembley hat-trick since Geoff Hurst\\'s treble in the 1966 World Cup final.\\n\"The final took place the day after a Manchester derby. It was ridiculous - Old Trafford on Saturday and Wembley on the Sunday was a hell of a weekend for us,\" said City winger Paul Simpson, who came on as a substitute in both games.\\n\"We were 2-0 down against United at half-time and drew 2-2. I just remember getting straight on the bus from Old Trafford and going down to London.\\n\"There was none of the massages or recovery you get after games today. They talk about eating in this \\'golden hour\\' after the game. But we literally just got up the next day, and started preparing for the final.\"\\nAlthough United fans did throw pies at the team coach as it was leaving the ground, food was not the main concern of two-goal striker Mark Lillis and his team-mates, in a side assembled at a fraction of the cost of today\\'s City squad.\\nThey were gagging for a pint after the derby exertions which had earned a point against a side including Mark Hughes, Gordon Strachan and Paul McGrath.\\nLillis, one of seven Manchester-born players in the Wembley side, told BBC Sport: \"We could see the manager, Billy McNeill, was having a couple of beers at the front of the coach and I asked on behalf of the team if we could get together at the hotel and just have one beer and then go to bed.\\n\"He went absolutely mad and said: \\'What do you think we are, a pub team?\\'\\n\"I looked back up the bus and everyone was ducking behind chairs and under tables - none of them were backing me up.\\n\"We ended up getting to the hotel and I had to make do with a cup of tea instead.\"\\nChelsea, back then the surprise contenders in a wide-open title race, did not have as far to travel as City, but they also had a quick turnaround after beating Southampton on the Saturday.\\nWinger Pat Nevin, who was involved in three of the goals at Wembley, told BBC Sport the rapid response to the win at the Dell didn\\'t faze him in the slightest.\\n\"Playing two games in two days had absolutely no effect on me,\" Nevin told BBC Sport.\\n\"I had been a long-distance runner before I was a footballer and I saw it as an advantage because I thought: If everyone else is knackered, I will be OK.\\n\"Wembley was a huge, lush pitch and particularly draining to play on, but we didn\\'t do anything special at all after beating Southampton.\\n\"I think we came back on the coach and went home. And our warm-down after winning the cup was parading the trophy on the pitch. We wouldn\\'t have considered doing any stretching.\"\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThe competition came about because of the European ban on English teams following the Heysel disaster in 1985.\\nIt was the brainchild of Chelsea chairman Ken Bates for teams in the top two divisions of the Football League.\\nDismissed by most as a needless competition created purely to swell the coffers during difficult times, participation was voluntary, and the inaugural competition was not surprisingly snubbed by \\'The Big Five\\' of Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Everton.\\nEven supporters of the teams who did enter were far from convinced by its merits, as some pitiful crowds in the regional group stages and knockout rounds proved.\\n\"Supporters stayed away in droves,\" recalled Chelsea\\'s official historian Rick Glanvill. \"When Chelsea beat West Bromwich Albion on a Wednesday night in dull, wet mid-November, there were barely 4,000 there to witness Garth Crooks miss the decisive shootout penalty.\"\\nYet something \"magical happened\" when Wembley Way loomed into view.\\n\"In the early rounds it wasn\\'t taken seriously but Chelsea hadn\\'t been to Wembley for a long time,\" said Nevin.\\n\"We were a bit tired but Manchester City brought a huge number of fans down and we had a huge number of fans too.\\n\"I had a really enjoyable day - it wasn\\'t the FA Cup or the League Cup but, for that moment and for the Chelsea fans, it was them getting to a place where they felt they should be.\\n\"Now if you look back it has a very, very little importance. But at the time it was a big deal.\"\\nTwo teams both playing in their away kits produced one of the least well-known, but certainly one of the most exciting finals ever to grace the old Wembley.\\n\"I think it was the only time I ever won anything at Wembley,\" Chelsea legend John Hollins - their manager at the time - told BBC Sport.\\n\"I lost against Spurs in 1967, we won the FA Cup in 1970 after a replay at Old Trafford and I don\\'t want to talk about 1972 [League Cup defeat against Stoke]!\"\\nChelsea trailed to an early Steve Kinsey strike, but David Speedie headed a leveller on his way to the first Wembley treble since Hurst\\'s and what remains only the second hat-trick in a senior domestic cup final in the 93-year history of Wembleys old and new - the other was by Stan Mortensen in the 1953 FA Cup final.\\nStand-in striker Colin Lee, who was playing in place of injured England forward Kerry Dixon, also scored twice as the men in white went 5-1 up in a ludicrously open game.\\nBut incredibly, City - inspired by some sumptuous wingplay by Simpson - hit back through a spectacular headed Doug Rougvie own goal, which came in the middle of two strikes by Lillis.\\n\"One thing I\\'ll always remember,\" said Lillis, \"is being stood on the halfway line after Chelsea had scored, looking up and seeing where my family were and then looking round at the big scoreboard showing 5-1 and thinking: \\'Oh God, I can\\'t go back to Manchester now. I\\'ll just get hammered by my family and everyone else.\\'\\n\"Before we knew it, Simmo came on and we were back in the game.\"\\nHollins added: \"It was a fantastic match and we played some lovely football.\\n\"Coming to the best stadium in the world, you want to win, no matter what the cup. We were cruising and maybe took the foot off the pedal a bit but we just about did enough. At least the finish made it exciting.\"\\nThe crowd on a sunny day in north London is recorded as 67,236 but, although it now seems incomprehensible, punters could pay on the day. And, by nearly all accounts, it would seem there were significantly more there than suggested by the official attendance - impressive as it was.\\nIt cost as little as £5 to get in and £1 for the programme, but supporters from both sides were seen slipping through the turnstiles at the Twin Towers.\\nStaggeringly there were also those who scaled the Wembley walls to get in for free and, in the days of standing at Wembley - and depending who and what you believe - estimates put the total \\'extra\\' attendees as anything from between 2-10,000.\\nWhatever the actual size of the crowd, it was of a number befitting such a memorable cup final.\\nSadly for Chelsea, their post Wembley title challenge imploded. They managed just nine more points from their remaining 11 games and finished sixth, 17 points behind champions Liverpool.\\nCity\\'s young side finished the season in 15th place - just four points clear of the relegation zone, but went down the following season.\\nAnd the tournament itself? It lasted seven more years, under three different guises, but was never taken that seriously.\\n\"The 1986 final was not live on TV and there are hardly any clips of it on the internet,\" said Lillis. \"Most people have forgotten about it and I look back sometimes and think \\'did that really happen?\\', but it was one of the best moments of my career.\"\\nAt Wembley in 1986, Chelsea\\'s starting line-up cost a total of £745k, while City\\'s first XI was put together for just £433.5k.\\nThere were six Scots, 14 Englishman, with four more on the bench, a German-born Welshman in David Phillips, and Barnsley-born Republic of Ireland international defender Mick McCarthy.\\nThe last time the two sides met in the league - a comprehensive 3-0 home win for City in August - there were only four Englishman between the two starting line-ups, with just two more from the 14 players on the bench. Only John Terry, who started but was taken off at the break, was home grown.\\nHere\\'s how an extract from an article by Peter Gardner, in the Manchester Evening News of 24 March 1986, summed it all up (via citytilidie.com):\\n\"At least the Full Members Cup will go down into the record books with some dignity and respectability.\\n\"The Football League\\'s most embarrassing and ill-conceived competition finished a money spinner at Wembley yesterday. A remarkable 68,000 turn-out poured in an equally staggering £500,000-plus.\"', 'summary': 'Imagine the conversation.', 'id': '35782829'}\n"

In this text summarization task, both `document` and `summary` texts are tokenized. The tokenizer generates `input_ids` (document tokens), `attention_mask` (a mask to ignore the padding token indices in `input_ids`), and `labels` (summary tokens). In the specific case of the T5 model, `decoder_input_ids` (the `labels` tokens shifted one position to the right with a padding token at the start) do not need to be passed during training, as the model generates them automatically from `labels`."

        "The [Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/rouge) metric is a set of measures used to evaluate the quality of text translation and summarization. It includes several variants, such as ``rouge1``, which measures the overlap of unigrams between the generated summary and the reference summary; ``rouge2``, which evaluates the overlap of bigrams; ``rougeL``, which considers the longest sequence of overlapping tokens; and  ``rougeLsum``, which computes ROUGE-L at the summary level. Additionally, these metrics can be assessed at different levels of granularity, such as ``low``, ``mid``, and ``high``, representing various thresholds of overlap. Each component of the ROUGE metric is evaluated on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates an exact match between the predictions and the references.\n"

These values indicate that the model has medium to high quality. As will be shown later, the model generally performs well in summarizing both short and long texts, but even so, `rouge1` does not exceed 50%. This is because abstractive summarization is a challenging task, more so than translation, and there is only one very concise reference (real summary) for each prediction. Of course, as with translation, ROUGE scores would be higher with multiple references since summaries can vary in length and use synonymous words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, it is important to note that even more advanced models, such as **BART Large** (over 400 million parameters) fine-tuned with this same XSum dataset, achieve only a [**`rouge1` score of 45.45**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-xsum) (not exceeding 50%) on the test dataset, highlighting the complexity of the text summarization task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, it is worth mentioning that, as stated in the [T5 research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf), a higher ROUGE score does not always mean higher quality summaries. However, compared to the Transformer model trained from scratch (`rouge1` of 27.66), significantly better results are achieved both in the ROUGE metric and in summary quality."

Mrs Merkel's approval ratings have gone up and down in recent months as a result of her refugee policy but they remain the envy of other world leaders.<br>Even so, she will be battling the tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the States and which is also washing across Europe.

The next incumbent must not only lead the country but deal with a fragmenting EU, in a world which may be much changed by the new US administration.<br>It's widely (sometimes grudgingly ) accepted here that there simply isn't another realistic candidate for the job.

What does this mean?<br>Consumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households.<br>Understanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time.<br>The \"great and small\" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household.<br>One theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy.<br>This focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found.<br>A more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis.<br>Their system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, \"has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation\".<br>Prof Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys.<br>To take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition.<br>His work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid.<br>In addition to the greater recognition of his work, and the further respect of his peers, Prof Deaton receives a financial price of 8m Swedish krona ($966,000; Â£630,000).<br>Born in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, Prof Deaton attended Fettes College, a private school in the city, before going on to study at Cambridge University.<br>After teaching at Cambridge and the University of Bristol, he continued his economics career in the US.<br>He holds both British and American citizenship.<br>Unlike the other five annual Nobel prizes, the economics one was not established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, although like the Physics and Chemistry prizes it is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.<br>Instead it was set up by Sweden's central bank in 1968 as a memorial to Mr Nobel, who died in 1896.<br>Its official title is the Riksbank's Prize in Economic Sciences.<br><br>\n",

        "**Conclusion:** The model is effective in generating summaries of both short and long texts. However, if further improvement is desired, it is necessary to fine-tune or use larger and more robust models, such as T5 Large or BART Large. Additionally, to enable the model to generate summaries that are not only concise but also longer and more detailed, it is necessary to fine-tune it with more robust datasets, which will require better computational capabilities than the free TPU of Colab (or many more hours of training using TensorFlow checkpoints). Nonetheless, for generating concise summaries of news articles, this model is more than sufficient."
